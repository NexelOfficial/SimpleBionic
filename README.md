# SimpleBionic

Bionic reading is a new method of reading by guiding the eyes through the text with aritifial fixation points. By making the first part of a word bold, the brain center can complete the word in the brain and skip the rest of the text.
SimpleBionic is a way to very easily enable bionic reading for webpages. By default, only paragraphs will be made bionic, but you can modify the config file to add other elements aswell.

# How to install
### Google Chrome (And most other Chromium browsers):
Installing the extension from source is done by opening the extensions page, enabling the `Developer mode` toggle, en then adding an Unpacked extension. Simple select the cloned folder and you should be good to go.

### Firefox:
Firefox users have a harder time installing from source. The best solution to permanently install the extension from source without having to re-add it everytime the browser restarts, is by using the Developer edition of Firefox. In the Developer edition of Firefox, navigate to `about:config` and look for the `xpinstall.signatures.required` entry. Set this to false. Now go to `about:addons` and install the add-on from file after archiving it to a `.zip` file.
